ConsenSys R&D 
============
Senior Researcher
Oct 2019 to Dec 2021

- Crosschain Work
Performed Security Analysis of Atomic Crosschain Technologies
Contributed towards the development of Atomic Crosschain Technology prototype on top of Java-based Ethereum Client, known as, Hyperledger Besu. GitHub Handle: Raghavendra80.
Published a blog on state-of-art research in Crosschain technology. 

- Ethereum 2 work 
Proposed an ‘Atomic Cross Shard user-level Ether transfer’ mechanism.
Ethereum 1x (Stateless Ethereum)
Proposed a way to adapt pointproofs technology for witness compression.
Researched and presented polynomial commitments for Witness compression

Oracle Labs, Brisbane, Australia
=====================================
Senior Researcher
Jan 2014 to Oct 2019

- At Java Vulnerability Detection team
Researched on a type system for information flow security for programming languages
Designed and implemented various security analyses on top of context-sensitive points-to analysis designed for libraries addressing the challenge of scalability,
Initiated a new research projects on adaptive context-sensitive points-to analysis for large programs, hybrid analysis for framework-based web application analyses

- At PLSQL Vulnerability Detection team
Designed a static program analysis algorithm to identify cursor leaks in PL/SQL code. Implemented in C++ in the in-house Parfait/LLVM framework.
Working on identifying (first-order and second-order) SQL injections in PL/SQL code. Invented ways to model data flows through database operations under closed-world and open-world scenarios.

Postdoctoral Fellowship
======================
International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore
Jun 2013 to Dec 2013
I worked on a research project to generate test cases for embedded system softwares meeting various coverage criteria. Here we investigated on designing dynamic symbolic executions mechanisms for state chart representations of embedded systems in Matlab.

PhD
======
Dept. of CSA, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 
Jan 2007 to Jun 2013
Supervisor: Prof. Deepak D’Souza.
Thesis: Model Checking Infinite State Systems for Information Flow Security Properties

I worked on the specification and verification of trace-based and bisimulation-based security properties on various classes of infinite state systems - Petri nets, pushdown systems, one counter automata. I also investigated on the problems of verifying some of the known security definitions against programs. 

Masters
=======
Dept. of CSA, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 
Aug 2004 to Jan 2007
Thesis: Verification of Information Flow Security Properties
Supervisor: Prof. Deepak D’Souza. 

I worked on automatically verifying trace-based information security properties. We gave methods to automatically verify many of them for abstract systems like finite automata.

Ittiam Systems 
==============
Software Engineer
Aug 2002 to Jul 2004
Ittiam Systems (http://ittiam.com) is a DSP technology company. I programmed in C and assembly languages on different embedded processors. I worked on implementing speech codecs: GSM AMR, G.728, and audio codecs MPEG 1 /2 Layer 1 /2 /3 on different embedded processors like Videocore, ARC, ARM.

Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Science)
=====================================
Sep 1998 to Jul 2002

Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering, Mysore, Karnataka, India, affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum, Karnataka, India.

Projects: (a) a graphics editor in C for DOS  operating system, (b) a text editor for Linux using ncurses library, (c) Simulation of Routing Algorithms” in C on Linux, (d) automated face recognition system using Machine Learning techniques in C, and (e) many hobby game projects. Undergraduate dissertation was on “MP3 Decoder on C54X processor” as an internship at Ittiam Systems.
